 * two questions the auditing exists for: what did the archive hear, and who changed what.
 *
 * <p>
 * The decision and the payout are two transactions, and the notice about the decision is
 * sent between them - late, because the archive is away at the first attempt. So by the
 * time the notice is delivered the loan approval has moved on, which is the situation
 * this blueprint is about and the reason the test can assert on the difference.
