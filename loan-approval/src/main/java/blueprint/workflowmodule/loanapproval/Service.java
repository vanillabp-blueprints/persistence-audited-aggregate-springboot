/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan
 * approval, expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells
 * {@link Workflow} what happened, {@code riskAssessed} rather than "complete the user
 * task", and that class decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs
 * through {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}, which calls the methods below when the process
 * reaches a task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Three of these methods write the loan approval, so three of them produce a revision:
 * the credit rating, the decision, and the payout after it. The decision is also the
 * moment the compliance archive has to hear about, and {@link ComplianceNotices} writes
 * that notice inside the same transaction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the methods the API calls, because
 * answering a user task has to run in a transaction. It is deliberately absent from the
 * methods a task handler calls: VanillaBP already runs a task in a transaction it owns,
 * and a transaction declared here would break the guarantees that come with it.
 * </p>
