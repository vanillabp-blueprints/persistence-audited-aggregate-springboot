/**
 * How this application stores its workflow aggregate, and how it reads a state the
 * aggregate had before. The second half is what this blueprint exists for.
 *
 * <p>
 * VanillaBP finds the repository of an aggregate by itself, so most blueprints have no
 * class like this. An application which audits needs one, because two of the questions
 * VanillaBP may ask can only be answered by the auditing: which state the aggregate
 * stands at, and what it looked like at a state somebody names. The rest of the methods
 * is the repository, spelled out.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both auditing methods have a default in the interface, and both defaults are the
 * behaviour of an application without an auditing: no state is named, and every load
 * reads the current one. So overriding them is the whole step from "not audited" to
 * "audited", and nothing else in the application has to know.
 * </p>
 *

  /**
   * The id of the change this transaction is making, which is how a caller names the

   *
   * <p>
   * The revision itself has no number yet. Envers writes the revision row while the
   * transaction commits, and an outbox entry is written before that, so an entry which
   * named the number would name something nobody has. The application therefore makes up
   * an id of its own, {@link ChangeBeingMade}, and the revision of this transaction is
   * written with that id in it. The id exists immediately, it belongs to the whole
   * transaction rather than to a single write, and reading it back is a query.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * The other way round works too, for an application which uses optimistic locking: the
   * version attribute of the aggregate names a state as well. It is assigned per write
   * though, so a transaction which writes twice names a state its audit row does not
   * carry - see the README.

   * revision carrying the id is looked up first, and its number is what Envers is then

   * Answering {@code null} says the state is gone, which happens once the auditing was
