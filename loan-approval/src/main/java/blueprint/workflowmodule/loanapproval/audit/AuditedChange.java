/**
 * One change, as the auditing knows it: a number, the moment it happened and the person
 * it came from.
 *
 * <p>
 * Envers writes a row of this kind per transaction which touched an audited entity, and
 * every audit row points at one of them. The number names a state of the loan approval,
 * and the id next to it names the same state in a way the application can write down
 * before the transaction is over.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Without a class like this, Envers writes a table of its own called {@code REVINFO} which
 * holds the number and the moment and nothing else. The annotation names the listener
 * filling the column this application adds, and both together are all it takes to replace
 * the default.
