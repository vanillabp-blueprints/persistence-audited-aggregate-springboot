/**
 * The stand-in for the compliance archive, so the blueprint runs without one.
 *
 * <p>
 * It writes the notice into the log, and it turns the first attempt down. That refusal is
 * arranged: an archive which answers right away would receive the decision while the
 * decision is still the newest state, and there would be nothing to see. Turned down
 * once, the notice waits in the outbox until the retry, the process books the payout
 * meanwhile, and the line it finally writes shows the loan approval without the payout.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Nothing about that is unusual for an outbox. A receiver is away now and then, and the
 * entry waits - minutes on a bad day, days when somebody is on holiday. This class only
 * makes the ordinary case happen on the first run.
 * </p>
