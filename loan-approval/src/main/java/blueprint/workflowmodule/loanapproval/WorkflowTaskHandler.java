/**
 * What the process tells the application: the incoming half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * A driving adapter, the same kind of thing as {@link ApiController}: something outside
 * triggers, and the trigger is translated into a call to {@link Service}. That the caller
 * is a BPMS rather than a browser changes nothing about the direction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every method here runs on a thread of the BPMS, where no person is acting. The changes
 * they make therefore end up in the trail under the name the auditing uses for the
 * process itself.
