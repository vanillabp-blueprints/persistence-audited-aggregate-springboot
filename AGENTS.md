# persistence-audited-aggregate

Keeps every state the workflow aggregate ever had, with the person who caused it, using
Hibernate Envers. On top of that it shows what an auditing is for: a report written in the
transaction of an event and sent later carries the id of its change, and the application
reads the state back at that change when the report goes out. A delta on top of
`module-single`.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

**The rule this blueprint is built on:** the id naming a state has to exist before the report
about that state is written down, and that happens before the transaction is flushed.
Everything else here follows from that one sentence.

`TestApplication`, `WorkflowModuleTest`, `Simulator` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are identical
in every blueprint - copy them unchanged. Everything specific to the use case belongs into
the test extending `WorkflowModuleTest`, never into the base class.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Decide whether the case needs an auditing at all. It costs a second write per change and
   a table which only grows, and it pays where somebody has to answer later for what was
   decided. Do not switch it on because it is available.
2. Add `spring-data-envers` and put `@Audited` on the workflow aggregate. That alone gives
   the audit table and a revision table called `REVINFO`, and the schema tool creates both.
3. Add a revision entity and its listener. The trail names a person that way, which is
   usually the reason for the auditing, and the same listener writes the id which lets a
   state be named before it exists. Neither can be injected, so both travel on the thread.
   The person is bound around the call which opens the transaction, because Envers writes
   the revision when that transaction commits and a name taken back earlier comes too late.
4. Implement `AggregatePersistenceAware` for the aggregate. What the interface asks for is
   the repository spelled out. Two methods of your own go next to it:
   `idOfTheChangeBeingMade` answers the id of the change the running transaction is making,
   and `loadByIdAsOfChange` looks up the revision carrying that id and reads the aggregate at
   it, answering `null` where it is gone. VanillaBP knows neither, so an application without
   an auditing has neither.
5. Name the state with an id of your own, not with the revision number. Envers numbers a
   revision while the transaction commits, which is after a report about the event was
   written down. Do not reach for `AuditReader#getCurrentRevision(..., true)` either: it is
   deprecated and what it points at runs at commit time as well. The version attribute of an
   application which uses optimistic locking is the other candidate, and it is assigned per
   write, so a transaction which writes twice names a state its audit row does not carry.
6. Put the id on the report, as one of its arguments. VanillaBP carries it and reads nothing
   in it, and the handler loads the state at that change when the report goes out. Everything
   written back into the BPMS reads the state of the moment instead, because that is where
   the case goes on.
7. Handle the state which is gone. An auditing is cleaned up at some point and a report may
   wait longer, so the load answers nothing and the report has to fall back to the current
   state and say so in the log.

What this does not cover: MongoDB, where nothing of this is built in and an application
versions its documents itself, and everything which does not come from the aggregate. The
assignee of a user task, its candidates and its due date are read out of the BPMS while the
entry is dispatched, and no auditing of yours reaches them.

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. `-Pcamunda8` needs a
running cluster and `vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address` configured; do not report a
failure of that profile as a defect of the generated code before having checked it.

`LoanApprovalIT` has to pass. Its first test decides the risk assessment, waits until the
payout was booked and then asserts that the notice the archive received carries the decision
without the payout, which is the aspect of this blueprint. Its second test asserts that the
trail names four changes and the author of each. `ApplicationSmokeTest` passing means the
application boots with the module on the classpath.

The test depends on the outbox trying again quickly: `vanillabp.outbox.attempt-frequency` is
two seconds in `src/test/resources/application.yaml`, against half a minute by default. A
test which waits for a notice without setting it runs into its timeout.

Do not report success without having run this.
